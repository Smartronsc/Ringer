Ruby utilities in support of productivity!

This is powerful stuff when you are trying to find that one little thing somewhere that you know is there.
Read the full IBM description in the link below to see what all this will do, today I just have basic exclude running.
Keep in mind typically you would be looking at source code with this, not vegetables.

So many times I have missed IBM's Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) over the years 
that this is a start on a replacement. Ruby, it seems, is perfect for doing it in. By "it" I mean
critical things like exclude all lines in the source then find all xyz in the excluded lines. Hugely
productive things that IBM is never going to publish and for good reason. ISPF should have been in 
Eclipse years ago.

Good old IBM, here is the documentation:
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/zosbasics/com.ibm.zos.zconcepts/zconcepts_138.htm

Granted, it the IBM implementation laughable in 2018 but "exclude" is one true killer feature.
