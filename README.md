# Ringer

## Ruby utilities in support of productivity!

This is powerful stuff when you are trying to find that one little thing somewhere that you know is there.

If your are to cut and paste into a file

* TextProcessor.rb
* UserInterface.rb
* FileManager.rb
* Ring.rb

in that order and remove the **require './** statements and the extra **#!/usr/bin/ruby** statements leaving one in the first line
you should be able to use this by entering **Ruby yourRingername.rb**

## Currently this is limited to a command line interface but even then it can be powerful.
