Ruby utilities in support of productivity!

This is powerful stuff when you are trying to find that one little thing somewhere that you know is there.
Read the full IBM description in the link below to see what all this will do, today I just have basic exclude running.

So many times I have missed IBM's Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) over the years that this is a start on a 
replacement. Ruby, it seems, is perfect for doing it in. Well, sort of, but now that I am a Rubist
I will look the other way. ISPF should have been in Eclipse years ago, after all, IBM was involved in Eclipse early on.  

Good old IBM, here is the documentation:

Granted, the IBM implementation is laughable in 2018 but "exclude" is one true killer feature.
